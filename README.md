# poem_generator


This is a simple poem generator program built using simple statistics randomness and simple nltk ideas. I would build a more advanced poem generator using RNN/LSTM later when I have time...
The program is pre-trained using the dataset in training folder.It has its model in model folder.You can specify re-train or not using the first boolean parameter, and also can decide lines of poems you like using second parameter.


Here is a sample output:
